- Demonstrated a 20% increase in sales conversion rates through optimised inquiry cycle time.
- Created Power BI dashboards that reduced data processing time by 30%.
- Utilized clustering algorithms to identify three distinct customer segments within the dataset.
- Improved sales targeting accuracy by 25% through the integration of predictive analytics.

#### HR Attrition Analytics Project
- Implemented data analysis methodology in R on an extensive HR dataset to explore the data and identify relationships.
- Increased the efficiency and productivity of business firms by using data analytics techniques. 
- Leverage Tableau to create dynamic dashboards to build analytical and predictive models, analyse data and use data analytics techniques.
- Informed strategic interventions HR to management and stakeholders based on insights from the dynamic dashboards.
- Demonstrated a data-driven approach in identifying and addressing factors impacting poor productivity and engagement of employees.
- Results distilled into actionable reports and visualisations.
- Enhanced organisational HR strategies through data-driven insights.

#### Business Analytics Project using Machine Learning on Wine Quality
- Developed various machine learning models (Random Forest, Decision Trees, K Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes) using R software to properly classify wines into different quality categories given their physiochemical attributes to provide quality control and assurance in the wine business
- Accurately classifying the quality of white wines based on their various features, will give the company the upper hand in making informed decisions related to their business.

-  allowing them to achieve higher customer satisfaction and profits.
- Employed cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression, to analyze and optimize supply chain logistics.

#### Operational Analytics Report using Microsoft Excel @Risk
- Constructed a probabilistic simulation model using @Risk to maximise profit of a business given the uncertain number of units to be sold and also ensuring the business makes a profit.
- Conducted a thorough analysis of revenue probability distribution. 
- Calculated key percentiles, identifying the 5th percentile and the 95th percentile, providing a 90% confidence interval for projected revenue.
- Delivered actionable insights to improve business forecasting and decision-making processes, ensuring a more accurate revenue prediction.
- Analysed cost probability distribution and profit probablity distribution of the business. 
- Calculated the 5th and 95th percentile, providing a 90% confidence interval for anticipated costs and projected profits.
- Delivered insights that enhanced cost prediction accuracy, improve profitability forecasting, supporting better financial planning and risk management strategies. 
- Developed a pricing model that recommended a customer charge to maximise profitability.
- Provided data-driven insights to optimise pricing strategy, ensuring higher profitability and more effective decision-making for the business.
- Developed and implemented a subscription simulation model to assess subscriber retention and profit, utilising churn rate, average profit per subscriber, and Net Present Value (NPV) calculations.
- Created a probability distribution model to predict subscriber behavior, incorporating churn rates and estimated profit, with a focus on NPV and subscriber loyalty over time.
- Conducted 10,000 iterations of simulations at various churn rates (5%, 10%, 20%, 25%) to forecast the impact of churn on total profit and subscriber retention.
- Analysed results, showing a negative correlation between churn rates, subscriber retention, and NPV, providing actionable insights for business strategies to reduce churn and improve customer loyalty.
- Recommended customer retention strategies, such as improving customer experience and utilising exit surveys, to reduce churn and optimize long-term profitability.
